    /**
     * Patient dashboard — returns module-wise pending balance for a given patient.
     *
     * Mirrors the logic of Report_model::getmodulewisebalance_report (used by
     * /admin/report/balanceamountreport) but is patient-scoped and aggregated
     * per module so the dashboard's "Pending Bills" card shows ONE row per
     * module with the total outstanding balance across all bills in that
     * module.
     *
     * Raw SQL is unavoidable here: a UNION ALL across 7 module billing tables
     * with subquery aggregates, an outer GROUP BY and HAVING is not cleanly
     * expressible in CI Query Builder. The inner UNION block is ported from
     * Report_model line 519+ with these deliberate differences:
     *   - WHERE patients.id = ? added to every subquery (patient scope)
     *   - blood_bank uses ONLY the 'blood_bank_all_recored' variant — the admin
     *     report has 3 variants of the same blood_issue records (component
     *     breakdown) which would triple-count on a per-patient summary
     *   - outer SELECT wraps with GROUP BY type, SUM, HAVING balance > 0
     *
     * Balance formula matches the admin report exactly: net_amount - paid_amount.
     * Refunds are not subtracted (consistent with how the admin report computes
     * its balance column).
     *
     * Returns array of rows: [type, balance_amount, bill_count, latest_date]
     * sorted by balance_amount DESC. Empty array if no module has balance > 0.
